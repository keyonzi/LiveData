# Live Data TEst

## Interview test
Write code that takes name of active band and returns the next concert date.

There are APIs available for Google Search Results, or Ticketmaster, or many other ticketing sites, but they are not free.
This is a simple tool that will search a small ticket site and return the first date if there is a result. There will be no
result if there is no tour for whatever the query may be. Either the band doens't exist, or they aren't touring. As I said,
it is a simple implementation.


Install required packages by running "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Run live_data_test.py
When prompted "Enter Band Name:", type in an existing band name that is currently touring and hit 'enter'.

Program will return with the first tour date
